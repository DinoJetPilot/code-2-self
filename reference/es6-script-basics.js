// =========================================
// ECMAScript, or ES, is a standardized version of JavaScript. Because all major browsers follow this specification, the terms ECMAScript and JavaScript are interchangeable.

// ES5 (ECMAScript 5) was finalized in 2009. ES6, released in 2015, added many powerful new features to the language. Some of these new features are: 

// arrow functions
// destructuring
// classes
// promises
// modules
